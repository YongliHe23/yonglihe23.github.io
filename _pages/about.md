[Curriculum Vitae (CV)] (https://github.com/YongliHe23/yonglihe23.github.io/blob/master/files/Yongli%20He_cv_UMich_20240619.pdf)

I'm a PhD student working under the guidance of Prof. Jon-Fredrik Nielsen(https://websites.umich.edu/~jfnielse/) at the University of Michigan. I earned my B.S. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.  My research interests include signal and image processing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computational imaging, inverse problems, and the connections between machine learning and constrained image reconstruction.
