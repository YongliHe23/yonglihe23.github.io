I'm a PhD student working under the guidance of [Prof. Jon-Fredrik Nielsen](https://websites.umich.edu/~jfnielse/) and [Prof. Douglas C. Noll](https://nollresearch.engin.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. I earned my B.S. degree in Physics from Huazhong Univ. of Science and Technology and my M.S. degree in ECE from Univ. of Michigan. My research interests include signal and image processing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computational imaging, inverse problems, and the connections between machine learning and constrained image reconstruction.
