I wrote this ISMRM-interesting-talk review a few month ago. Today I finally got a chance to publish it on my personal website as a blog. There is no attempt to make it an exhausting review. I just listed here a few interesting talks/abstracts I found either relevant to my research or pretty cool.

# Gradient-free frequency encoding imaging
**Number**: 1143
<br>**Authors**: Sai Abitha Srinivas, Antonio D Glenn, Christopher E Vaughn, Mark A Griswold, and William A Grissom<br>

This work experimentally demonstrates the usage of Bloch-Siegert effect in RF-gradient based
frequency encoding. Bloch-Siegert effect is referring to the shift of spin precession frequency when an
off-resonance RF field is applied. This effect was firstly discovered by Felix Bloch and Arnold Siegert
in 1940. However, it was not introduced in MR applications until 2010. In this seminal [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2933656/), Sacolick
proposed a phase-based $B_1^+$ mapping method leveraging the Bloch-Siegert effect.

Imagine we apply an RF field that has frequency $\omega_0+\omega_{RF}$, then in the rotating frame of this RF field(**Figure 1**), $B_1$ will appear static while spins precess in a frequency $\omega_{RF}$. This precession frequency offset is equivalent to a static magnetic field along z axis in the RF rotating frame (**Figure 1**). Its vector sum with the frequency induced by the $B_1$ field is the effective $B_1$:


Aren't headings cool?
